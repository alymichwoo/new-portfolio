## Hi, my name is Alyssa Woods. I create fun things for the web.

I'm a front-end developer (with a passion for design) who loves crafting enjoyable user experiences. Currently, I'm based in Long Beach, CA and open to projects and opportunies, so send me a message!

## About Me

With a background in performance psychology, education, and health/fitness, I'm passionate about understanding human behavior to help build more enjoyable and engaging user experiences. I also like using logic and my imagination to solve problems and tell stories.


I'd love to join a team that focuses on bringing unique ideas to life!


When I'm offline, you can find me at CrossFit, cheering on my favorite sports teams, or somewhere playing with dogs.
